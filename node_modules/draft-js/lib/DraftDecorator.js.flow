/**
 * A DraftDecorator is a strategy-component pair intended for use when
 * rendering content.
 *
 *   - A "strategy": A function that accepts a ContentBlock object and
 *     continuously executes a callback with start/end values corresponding to
 *     relevant matches in the document text. For example, getHashtagMatches
 *     uses a hashtag regex to find hashtag strings in the block, and
 *     for each hashtag match, executes the callback with start/end pairs.
 *
 *   - A "component": A React component that will be used to render the
 *     "decorated" section of text.
 *
 *   - "props": Props to be passed into the React component that will be used.
