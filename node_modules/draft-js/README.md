# [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/facebook/draft-js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/draft-js) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/draft-js.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/draft-js)

Draft.js is a JavaScript rich text editor framework, built for React and
backed by an immutable model.

- **Extensible and Customizable:** We provide the building blocks to enable
the creation of a broad variety of rich text composition experiences, from
simple text styles to embedded media.
- **Declarative Rich Text:** Draft.js fits seamlessly into
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) applications,
abstracting away the details of rendering, selection, and input behavior with a
familiar declarative API.
- **Immutable Editor State:** The Draft.js model is built
with [immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), offering
an API with functional state updates and aggressively leveraging data persistence
for scalable memory usage.

## API Notice

Before getting started, please be aware that we are changing the API of Entity storage in Draft. Currently, the master branch supports both the old and new API. We hope to release this soon, as `v0.10.0`. Following that up will be `v0.11.0` which will remove the old API. This update will also include documentation on how to upgrade. If you are interested in helping out, or tracking the progress, please follow  [issue 839](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/839).

## Getting Started

Currently Draft.js is distributed via npm. It depends on React and React DOM which must also be installed.

```
npm install --save draft-js react react-dom
```

### Using Draft.js

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {Editor, EditorState} from 'draft-js';

class MyEditor extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {editorState: EditorState.createEmpty()};
    this.onChange = (editorState) => this.setState({editorState});
  }
  render() {
    return (
        <Editor editorState={this.state.editorState} onChange={this.onChange} />
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyEditor />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

Because Draft.js supports unicode, you must have the following meta tag in the `<head>` `</head>` block of your HTML file:

```
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```
Further examples of how Draft.js can be used are provided below.

### Examples

Visit https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/ to try out a simple rich editor example.

The repository includes a variety of different editor examples to demonstrate
some of the features offered by the framework.

To run the examples, first build Draft.js locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/facebook/draft-js.git
cd draft-js
npm install
npm run build
```

then open the example HTML files in your browser.

Draft.js is used in production on Facebook, including status and
comment inputs, [Notes](https://www.facebook.com/notes/), and
[messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com).
