# Installation

Enzyme should be installed using npm:

```bash
npm i --save-dev enzyme
```

Enzyme can be used with your test runner of choice. All examples in the documentation will be
provided using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [BDD style chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/),
although neither library is a dependency of enzyme.
